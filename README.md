Contribution score:
The contribution score for each member is an integer.
The default score for a member is 5.
The total score for the whole group must not exceed 5 * (number of members whose score > 0).
If a member gets zero points => that member gets zero for the whole group project assignment.
The maximum score for a member is 7.
The contribution score must be agreed upon by all members. If there are disagreements, you must inform the lecturer/coordinator before the due time.
The maximum score for the whole project is 35. If you get more than 35 (due to a high contribution score), the final score is 35.
